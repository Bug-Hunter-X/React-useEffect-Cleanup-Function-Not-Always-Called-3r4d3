# React useEffect Cleanup Function Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle issue related to the cleanup function within React's `useEffect` hook.  In certain scenarios, the cleanup function might not be executed as expected, leading to potential memory leaks or unexpected behavior.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that addresses this issue.

## Problem

The cleanup function within the `useEffect` hook is designed to perform actions like releasing resources (e.g., timers, event listeners) when a component unmounts or when its dependencies change.  However, in some circumstances, especially with rapid state changes, the cleanup might be skipped.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully considering the dependency array and ensuring the cleanup function is robust enough to handle various scenarios.  The solution file offers a modified implementation addressing this issue.
